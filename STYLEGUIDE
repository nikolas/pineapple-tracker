Pineapple Tracker Coding Style
------------------------------

Because good looking code==easy to maintain code.

Functions:
----------
Put opening curly-bracket on the same line, and no space between the closing
paren and the opening curly bracket.

static int void freqkey(int x){

}

No space between the closing paren and the curly bracket either.


Function naming:
----------------

Just a proposal... should we have every function that isn't exported in a .h
file begin with an underscore? I just thought it might make it easier to
differentiate between the two.. maybe it's not really necessary, though.
