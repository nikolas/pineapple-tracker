enhancements:
-------------
Keybindings:
	* comand mode
		* get backspace to work
		* tab completion (right now it ignores tabs)
	* visual mode for copy/paste like in lgpt
	* record mode?
	* u - undo
	* find&replace
	* porous paste

* control with a gamepad

* save as.. support

* port gui to libcaca.
branch?

* clean up gui.c someday
	* I tried to make a modes.c file for jammermode(), insertmode(), etc. but
	it's kind of complicated cause those functions use a lot variables from
	gui.c... I'd like to figure out how to seperate them, though

* make a frequency table for 44.1 khz

bugs:
----
* when switching to + or = in instrument view, the note is sometimes out of
	range if the params are high.

* '.' doesn't work with insert/replace

* tempo gets really fast if you set it too low... and weird things happen if
	you set it too high as well.

dreams:
------
config files
rainbow decibel meters on each track like AHX tracker
