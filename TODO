enhancements:
-------------
* complete and implement the SPEC
	* Visual mode

* pineapple.h uses one set of typedefs for uint8_t, etc, and
  hvl_replay.h uses a slightly different one. lets go with one 
  or the other.

* the songeditor needs to scroll horizontally for tunes with more than
  four channels!!

* make the sampling rate not affect the pitch of notes

* regulate framerate with SDL timer to use less CPU???
	* perhaps ncurses has some sort of timer...i know caca does...

* .pineapplerc
	Ability to configure:
	* colorschemes
	* initial/default step value?
	
* JACK driver

* MORE MODULAR
	* gui.c => ncurses_ui.c
		* port gui to libcaca?

* rainbow decibel meters on each track like AHX tracker

bugs:
----
* '-' will delete notes in tracktab for some reason, but this is actually 
	useful, so I think we should keep it. However, it should work in 
	song and instrument tabs too.

* '.' doesn't work with insert/replace

* backspace doesn't work on some computers

* yj and yk only work in track tab.

* from normal mode, press Vv, then exit visual mode with <esc> or v. the cursor moves left... why?

* M still acts weird if you are ^e'd down in a column

* sound doesn't always stop at the end of a song

* tempo gets really fast if you set it too low... and weird things happen if
	you set it too high as well.

* speed of vibrato, arpeggio, slide, faster than when we were running at 16khz

* If you press any of the arrow keys, the current instrument decreases, and it 
also acts like you pressed the escape key!

* ui doesn't update after pressing the first key of a two-key command like yy
	* tried a threading solution. didn't work like expected. -nik

* sound is REALLY wonky on amd64

* something is weird about the '@' command, sometimes it makes the program freeze, and
  when it doesnt make the program freeze, it doesnt loop right.
