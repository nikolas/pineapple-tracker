enhancements:
-------------
* complete and implement the SPEC
	* Visual mode

* make the sampling rate not affect the pitch of notes

* rainbow decibel meters on each track like AHX tracker

* JACK driver

* .pineapplerc
	Ability to configure:
	* colorschemes
	* initial/default step value?

* MORE MODULAR
	* gui.c => ncurses_ui.c
		* port gui to libcaca?
	* drawsonged() => drawsonged_hively() or drawsonged_pineapple()

* make :q not quit if there are unmodified changes, but :q! should quit no
	matter what.
	
* regulate framerate with SDL timer to use less CPU???
	* perhaps ncurses has some sort of timer...i know caca does...

bugs:
----
* '-' will delete notes in tracktab for some reason, but this is actually 
	useful, so I think we should keep it. However, it should work in 
	song and instrument tabs too.

* '.' doesn't work with insert/replace

* backspace doesn't work on some computers

* yj and yk only work in track tab.

* from normal mode, press Vv, then exit visual mode with <esc> or v. the cursor moves left... why?

* M still acts weird if you are ^e'd down in a column

* sound doesn't always stop at the end of a song

* tempo gets really fast if you set it too low... and weird things happen if
	you set it too high as well.

* speed of vibrato, arpeggio, slide, faster than when we were running at 16khz

* If you press any of the arrow keys, the current instrument decreases, and it 
also acts like you pressed the escape key!

* ui doesn't update after pressing the first key of a two-key command like yy

* sound is REALLY wonky on amd64
