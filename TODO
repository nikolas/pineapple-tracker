enhancements:
-------------
* complete and implement the SPEC

* control with a gamepad

* port gui to libcaca.
branch?

* make the sampling rate not affect the pitch of notes

* decide what should and should not be in stuff.h... and maybe rename it
	to pineapple.h

bugs:
----
* when switching to + or = in instrument view, the note is sometimes out of
	range if the params are high.

* '.' doesn't work with insert/replace

* tempo gets really fast if you set it too low... and weird things happen if
	you set it too high as well.

* speed of vibrato, arpeggio, slide, faster than when we were running at 16khz

* M acts weird

* backspace doesn't work on some computers (so far i've only tried it on a
	gentoo computer in the office). -nik

dreams:
------
config files
rainbow decibel meters on each track like AHX tracker
