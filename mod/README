Right now I'm just working on loading mod files, I'd rather not look at libmikmod, its pretty icky. It may be easier to
figure out how to load mods ourselves than figure out how to use a library and adapt it to our needs.

On the other hand, a library is bound to be much more compatable. That said, I'm still going to work on loading mods
myself for educational purposes if nothing else.

Also, Milkytracker doesn't use libmikmod, and it loads nearly everything you throw out it, so we could check the milkytracker
source if we get stuck, or need to know some really particular quirks about mod files.

I'm getting a lot of help from these websites:
